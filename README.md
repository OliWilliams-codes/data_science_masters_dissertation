# data_science_masters_dissertation
This covers my work for my Data Science Masters dissertation. Once the project has been completed all the analysis, paper and code will be made available.

Statsbomb_DataExploration
This project explores the structure of StatsBomb open data and demonstrates the reasoning behind data selection and feature extraction for football analytics.
It is designed for analysts, data scientists, and sports enthusiasts interested in understanding the raw data before applying advanced transformations.

Dependencies

This project uses:
  pandas – Data manipulation
  statsbombpy – Access to StatsBomb open data

Statsbomb_Feature Engineering
This is essentially an extension of the DataExploration piece to create a dataset suitable for data exploration avenues with the same dependencies.
